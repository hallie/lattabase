# Movie Database

Hello! Welcome to this.

To get started, make sure you have [Django 1.11](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.11/) installed.

Then, double check that you've got the secrets stashed with the right names in the right places:
```bash
export THE_MOVIE_DB_KEY='something-secret-that-is-not-this'
```

Run it with the following command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Finally, feel free to visit your friendly neighborhood [localhost](http://localhost:8000/) over on port `8000` for a moderately fun time.
